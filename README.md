The objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient face detection application that can identify and extract faces from images and video frames in real time.
However, current face detection techniques face several challenges, including variations in lighting, facial expression, pose, occlusion, and background clutter.
Therefore, there is a need for a robust face detection algorithm that can handle these challenges and provide high accuracy and speed.
